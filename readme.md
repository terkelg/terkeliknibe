After spending nearly four months searching for an apartment, I created a website to aid me in the process. The site gained viral attention in the Danish media, piggybacking on the popularity of the movie ['The Trouble with Terkel'](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1560987/). Although the site is no longer online, its source code is available on GitHub.
